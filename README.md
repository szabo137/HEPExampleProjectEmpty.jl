# HEPExampleProject.jl

`HEPExampleProject.jl` is a demonstration package for showcasing how to develop software
in the context of high-energy physics (HEP) using the Julia programming language. This project
serves as a template for researchers, developers, and students interested in adopting Julia
for HEP-specific workflows.

## Key Features

- **HEP-Focused Design**: Structures common to high-energy physics are implemented with a focus on performance and flexibility.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed to be easily extensible for new use cases and HEP-related calculations.
- **Integration with JuliaHEP**: Part of the [JuliaHEP](https://github.com/JuliaHEP) ecosystem, which aims to facilitate the use of Julia in high-energy physics research and analysis.

## Installation

This package is not registered (and most probably will never be).

To install `HEPExampleProject.jl`, use Julia's built-in package manager. In the Julia REPL, type:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("https://github.com/JuliaHEP/HEPExampleProject.jl")
```

Alternatively, you can enter the Pkg mode by pressing `]` in the REPL, then type:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaHEP/HEPExampleProject.jl
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can begin using `HEPExampleProject.jl` by importing the package:

```julia
using HEPExampleProject
```

### Example

The following example demonstrates a simple use of the package:

```julia
using HEPExampleProject
using Random

# define random number generator for reproducability
RNG = Xoshiro(137)

# Define some input parameters for the HEP process
incoming_electron_energy = 1000.0

# generate 1M events
event_list = generate_events_cpu(RNG,incoming_electron_energy,1_000_000)
```

If you separately install the package `StatsPlots` (`pkg> add StatsPlots`), you can plot
the generated events:

```Julia
using StatsPlots
plot_muon_cos_theta(event_list)
```
